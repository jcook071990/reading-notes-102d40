#Javascript

**Javascript Introduction**

Javascript is a lightweight compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is most well known as a scripting language for web pages but is also used with *Node.js*, *Apache CouchDB*, and *Adobe Acrobat*. Javascript is an object oriented language. 

**Javascript Variables**

There are 4 ways to declare a variable in Javascript:
-Var
-let
-const
-and nothing

Variables are containers for storing data.

var x = 1;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;

x, y and z are the variables. 

You can define the variables the same way with let:

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

And you can also write variables without declaring them

x = 1;
y = 2;
z = x + y;

**When should you use *const?**

If you don't think the value of the variable will change, then use *let*. If you think the value of the variable might change at some point, then use *const*.

**For instance:**

const price1 = 1;
const price2 = 2;
let total = price1 + price2;

**Identifiers**

All javascript variables must be identified with unique names. 
In our previous examples, x, y, and z were the identifiers. Identifiers can be simple names or more descriptive names such as age, sum, total value. Identifiers are case sensitive.

**Assignment Operator**

The ( = ) in Javascript is known as the *assignment* operator not and *equal* operator. The *equal* operator is actually written like ( == ).

**Declaring a variable**

Creating a variable in Javascript is called *declaring* a variable. Declare variables by using *var* or *let*.

var carName = "Mercedes";

or

let carName = "Mercedes";

Use and ( = ) sign to assign a value to the variable.
