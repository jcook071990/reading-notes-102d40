#Programming with Javascript

**Control Flow**

*Control Flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless of course the computer runs across the (extremely rare) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

**Functions**

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" calls it. 

function myFunction(p1, p2) {
    return p1 * p2;  *The function returns the product of p1 and p2*
}

**JavaScript Function Syntax**

A JavaScript function is defined with the *function* keyword, followed by a *name*, followed by parentheses ().

function *name*(parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter3) {
    *code to be executed*
}

**JavaScript Operators**

- (+) Addition
- (-) Subtraction
- (*) Multiplication
- (/) Division
- (++) Increment
- (--) Decrement
