**Text Editor**

Okay so you might be thinking "what exacltly is a text editor?". Well, a text editor is an application that allows you to write text. Some text editors 
allow you to write only text, and some editors allow you to write code. Your computer most likely already has a built in text editor. Depending on what
operating system you have will depend on your text editor. For example, MacOS comes with "Text Edit", and windows computers comes with "Notepad".

Now, using the text editor that was built into your computer is okay but it is not feasible. There are a variety of third party text editors available 
to you. One of the most common and highly praised text editors you can download is *Visual Studio Code* or VSCode. VSCode is a free to use text editor 
with an abundance of featers. Some of these features include *themes*, *code completion*, *syntax highlighting*, *extensions*, and more! Visual Studio 
Code is the go to text editor for most coding bootcamps, colleges, and professionals worldwide. 

You can checkout and/or download VSCode [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Terminal**

What is the terminal? The command line or *terminal* is a text based interface to the system. In ther terminal you are able to write commands and receive 
feedback from your computer. Here, you can change, add, and delete directoreies. You can also browse files, download software, and open VSCode. The 
terminal is a powerful tool that is just as important to a developer as a text editor. 

**Finding the terminal**

If you are on Mac, simply open your Spotlight Search and type "Terminal". If you are on Linux then go to **Applications -> System** or **Applications ->
Utilities**. You may also be able to *right-click* on the desktop and open your terminal from there. 

**Basic Commands**

Once you have your terminal open, type **pwd**, this stands for Print Working Directory. This command tells you what your current or present working 
directory is. It can be easy to get lost while you're moving arounbd inside the terminal. Use this command frequently to help keep track of where you are.

Another common command is **ls**. This command is used to know what files and directories are located here. The commans **ls** is short for list.
Using **ls -a** will list all files including hidden ones. 

**mkdir** is used to make a directory. Once you create a new directory you can use the command **cd** to change into that directory.
For example: 

mkdir new direcgtory
cd new directory

You are now inside of the new directory you just created!

There are many commands and neat tricks to use in the terminal that will help make your programming life a little easier.
