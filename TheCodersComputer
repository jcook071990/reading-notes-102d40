**Text Editor**

Okay so you might be thinking "what exacltly is a text editor?". Well, a text editor is an application that allows you to write text. Some text editors 
allow you to write only text, and some editors allow you to write code. Your computer most likely already has a built in text editor. Depending on what
operating system you have will depend on your text editor. For example, MacOS comes with "Text Edit", and windows computers comes with "Notepad".

Now, using the text editor that was built into your computer is okay but it is not feasible. There are a variety of third party text editors available 
to you. One of the most common and highly praised text editors you can download is *Visual Studio Code* or VSCode. VSCode is a free to use text editor 
with an abundance of featers. Some of these features include *themes*, *code completion*, *syntax highlighting*, *extensions*, and more! Visual Studio 
Code is the go to text editor for most coding bootcamps, colleges, and professionals worldwide.
