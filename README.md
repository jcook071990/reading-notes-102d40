# My Reading Notes!

**Bio:**

Hello! My name is Josh Cook. I am a US Army Veteran and I am currently transitioning into software development. I have some previous experience in coding and most recently I have been creating Roblox games using LUA and Blender with my brother and some of our friends. I am a father of one son, Logan whom is 4 years old, and a husband. I look forward to learning throughout this course and I hope to eventually get a job as a full time software engineer!

Growth mindset to me means continous learning. Constantly learning and practicing is how you improve professionally and personally over time.

**How to stay in a growth mindset:**

- Remember success is only possible through failure
- Practice makes better not perfect
- Take baby steps. Small goals turn into large goals.
- Take a break. Burn out is real.
