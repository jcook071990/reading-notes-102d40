# My Reading Notes!

*This is where i'm going to put my reading notes.*

**Growth mindset to me means continous learning. Constantly learning and practicing is how you improve professionally and personally over time.**

How to stay in a growth mindset:

- Remember success is only possible through failure
- Practice makes better not perfect
- Take baby steps. Small goals turn into large goals.
- Take a break. Burn out is real.
